# Jacob-Moore-Portfolio-Website
This is my portfolio website that I made using HTML, Css, and Bootstrap. I just recently started to learn web development and this is my first time ever using the Bootstrap framework to create a website. This is the website I plan to use to show my portfolio projects since I just recently started to try to build my portfolio with projects outside of school. I plan on refining this website a bit more as I learn more about web development, web design, HTML, Css, and Javascript.
